    <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
    <p>Flat iron steak is cut from beef shoulder. To make a flat iron steak, butchers remove the connective tissue to separate the top shoulder blade into two cuts: One is the top blade, the other is the flat iron.</p>
    <p>Flat iron steak is nicely marbled and is less expensive than other steaks, which makes it a popular choice among home cooks. When it's cooked correctly, flat iron steak is wonderfully tender and juicy.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><em>1 (2 pound) flat iron steak</em></li>
            <li><em>2 ½ tablespoons olive oil</em></li>
            <li><em>2 cloves garlic, minced</em></li>
            <li><em>1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley</em></li>
            <li><em>¼ teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary</em></li>
            <li><em>½ teaspoon chopped fresh chives</em></li>
            <li><em>¼ cup Cabernet Sauvignon (or other dry red wine)</em></li>
            <li><em>½ teaspoon salt</em></li>
            <li><em>¾ teaspoon ground black pepper</em></li>
            <li><em>¼ teaspoon dry mustard powder</em></li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><em>Place steak inside a large resealable bag. Stir olive oil, garlic, parsley, rosemary, chives, red wine, salt, pepper, and mustard powder together in a small bowl.</em></li>
            <br>
            <li><em>Pour marinade over steak in the bag. Press out as much air as you can and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 hours.</em></li>
            <br>
            <li><em>Heat a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Place steak in the hot skillet and discard any remaining marinade; sear and cook steak for 3 to 4 minutes on each side for medium rare, or to your desired degree of doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium rare.</em></li>
            <br>
            <li><em>Allow steak to rest for about 5 minutes before serving.</em></li>
            <br>
        </ol>
