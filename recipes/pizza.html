            <li><em>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</em></li>
            <li><em>1 teaspoon white sugar</em></li>
            <li><em>2 ½ cups bread flour</em></li>
            <li><em>2 tablespoons olive oil</em></li>
            <li><em>1 teaspoon salt</em></li>

            <li><em>Transfer to the prepared pizza pan.</em></li>
            <br>
